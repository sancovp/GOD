# GOD DUO CICD Implementation Plan

## 1. Define the GOD Version of DUO Framework

- Clearly articulate the components of the GOD (General Ontology Designer) version of DUO
- Specify how it differs from the current DUO implementation
- Outline the key features that enable self-improvement and ontology design

## 2. Design the CICD Loop

- Define the stages of the CICD pipeline specific to this project
- Determine how the GOD DUO framework integrates into each stage
- Specify triggers for CI and CD processes

## 3. Implement Base Classes

- Identify the core base classes needed for the system
- Implement these classes with clear documentation
- Ensure classes are designed with reification in mind

## 4. Develop Reification Process

- Create a mechanism for reifying base classes IRL
- Implement logging and validation for the reification process
- Design error handling and recovery procedures

## 5. Integrate ICL Building with LOL

- Define the structure and syntax of LOL
- Implement the ICL building process using LOL
- Create documentation and examples for LOL usage

## 6. Implement Disciple Creation Process

- Design the Disciple class structure
- Implement the process for creating a Disciple instance
- Develop training procedures for the Disciple

## 7. Create Testing Framework

- Develop unit tests for base classes
- Implement integration tests for the CICD pipeline
- Create validation tests for the reification process

## 8. Set Up Monitoring and Logging

- Implement logging throughout the system
- Set up monitoring for the CICD pipeline
- Create dashboards for system health and performance

## 9. Documentation

- Write comprehensive documentation for the GOD DUO framework
- Create user guides for interacting with the system
- Document the CICD process and how to maintain/extend it

## 10. Review and Iteration

- Conduct a thorough review of the implemented system
- Identify areas for improvement or optimization
- Plan for the next iteration of development

## Next Steps

1. Begin with implementing the core components of the GOD DUO framework
2. Set up a basic CICD pipeline
3. Implement and test the reification process for base classes
4. Develop the ICL building process with LOL
5. Create a prototype Disciple

Remember to document each step thoroughly and continuously test the system as you build it. This will ensure a stable foundation for further development of the SANCTUARY system.
